# Priority Queue Implementation

## Overview

This repository contains a custom implementation of a priority queue in Python. It is designed to demonstrate how to manage a list of tasks based on their priority without using Python's built-in `heapq` module. This implementation is particularly useful for educational purposes or small-scale projects where task prioritization is required.

## Features

- **Custom Priority Queue**: Implements priority-based task management without external dependencies.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps in understanding basic data structures and algorithms in Python.
- **Simple and Extendable**: Easy to understand and can be extended for more complex use cases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

Clone this repository to get started with the priority queue:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turava/PriorityQueueTaskManager.git
cd PriorityQueueTaskManager
